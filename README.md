latest version of the mod even if I haven't posted the latest version on planet minecraft. In this file, I will tell you how to make the source into a jar file if you wanna play
the latest version and how to set up a mod workspace using this in case u wanna modify the mod **FOR YOURSELF**.

First, you gotta clone the repository and extract the .zip file
